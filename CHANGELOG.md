# Yomi's Joban Client Mod 1.2.4 has been released

## Compatible MTR Version
MTR 3.2.2 -> Latest

## Changes
- Compatible with YMTR.
- PIDS Preset may now specify the color displayed when the PIDS is showing different cars, see [wiki](https://www.joban.tk/wiki/JCM:Joban_PIDS#Cars_Color) for details.
- Fences on Thales Ticket Barrier (Bare) will no longer disappear as long as there's any block next to the barrier fence.

## Fixes
- This fixes a bug where some block (like walls) would have a transparent side when a Spot Light is placed below.
- Butterfly light now blinks correctly to a fixed interval

# Minecraft 1.20
This release adds an unofficially supported Minecraft 1.20 build.  
Note that the official changes for 1.20 on the MTR Mod has not been pushed, meaning we have to compile the mod with the 1.19.4 version of the MTR Mod.
As such, this build will be a bit rough around the edges. Unless your server has already been upgraded to 1.20, we recommend staying on 1.19.4 or below for the best experience.  

On Fabric, the blocks are located in a separate creative tab, while on Forge it is located in the vanilla redstone tab.  
No support for MC 1.20 will be given at the moment, use at your own risk (And with backup!).
